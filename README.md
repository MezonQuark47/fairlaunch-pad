## 🎯 Problem

NFT and token launches are plagued by **bot sniping** - automated scripts that buy up entire supplies within seconds, leaving genuine community members empty-handed. This creates:

- 🤖 Unfair advantage for bot operators
- 😤 Frustrated communities
- 📉 Damaged project reputation
- 💸 Inflated secondary market prices

## 💡 Solution

**FairLaunch Pad** leverages [Ethos Network](https://ethos.network)'s on-chain reputation scoring to create **tiered access** that rewards real humans and blocks bots.

### How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** → User connects their Ethereum wallet
2. **Ethos Score Check** → System analyzes on-chain reputation
3. **Tiered Access** → Access level determined by score

### Tier System

| Tier | Score | Benefits |
|------|-------|----------|
| 👑 **VIP** | > 2,000 | Guaranteed allocation + 50% discount |
| ✅ **Verified** | 500 - 2,000 | FCFS (First Come, First Served) access |
| 🤖 **Rejected** | < 500 | Bot detected - no access |
